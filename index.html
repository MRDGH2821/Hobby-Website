      <p>Greetings, I’m Mihir Rabade, Currently studying at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune. I’m an Introvert &amp; an enthusiast about technology, especially in Gaming sector. Earlier I was more fascinated about front end of things. But
        once
        I
        went behind the scenes, I became interested in Game Development. For now I have started with a 2D Side Scroller project.
        Simply learning didn’t help me unless I applied it, therefore I have a tendency to apply the knowledge I learnt.</p>
